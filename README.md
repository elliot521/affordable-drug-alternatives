- Collect data on drug prices, availability, and global patient population
- Rank clinical trial evidence by strength (e.g., RCTs, systematic reviews)
- Populate a comparison table of ketamine vs esketamine
- Explore and document useful databases (e.g., GBD, Orphanet)
- Support future automation using Python and LLMs (ChatGPT)

## ðŸ›  Tools & Resources

- Python, Pandas, SQL
- PubMed, Global Burden of Disease (GBD), Orphanet
- ChatGPT / LLMs for summarizing and ranking evidence
